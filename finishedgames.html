            After learning about random numbers in Python, I wanted to test my knowledge by creating a quick game. <br>
            <br>
            It uses a simple if/else statement to ask if your number is lower or higher than the random number it generated. <br>
            <br>
            After three guesses it asks if it has your number correct, and wins if it does.  <br>
            <br>
            The game itself is very simple, but it did present a few different problems, like how to narrow the guessing field.  <br>
            <br>
            I enjoyed problem solving these issues in order to get a reasonably accurate guessing game. <br>

            The next project I undertook was a text based adventure game called Shipwrecked. <br>
            <br>
            It was built in python by myself and 5 others; Lucas, Reyanud, Nasra, Kamil, and Ea-Nkoy.  <br>
            <br>
            In it your character traverses the island, through several different areas, looking for tools and an eventual way off the <br> island. <br>
            <br>
            There are several npc's, battle systems, ASCII images, updating maps and even different endings.  <br>
            <br>
            It was a challenge to combine the different elements that each of the team brought in, but the game is only improved by <br> having all of their inputs.
