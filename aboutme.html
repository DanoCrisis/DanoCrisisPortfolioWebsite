        Hi my name is Daniel Green, gamertag DanoCrisis, and I'm an aspiring game developer. I have always had a strong interest in games but never thought I would get to be the person designing and creating them.  <br>
        <br>
        I went to Hull University, were I did a physics degree. I did touch upon coding a little then, in the form of C++, but only for doing anylitical problem solving. <br>
        <br>
        My career so far has been centred around administration or retail and nothing to do with software or gaming. <br>
        <br>
        In my spare time however, I have started to look at the bluepints system of Unreal Engine 4; as a gateway into coding and developing games full time. <br>
        <br>
        Most recently I have done an introduction to coding course with Code Nation, where I have added Python, HTML and CSS languages to my skillset, and I hope to be able to put these to use within the gaming industry shortly. <br>
