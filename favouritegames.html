        <p>
            Released in 1999 for the PlayStation 1; Dino Crisis was developed by the same team that had worked on the successful Resident Evil game 3 years earlier. <br>
            <br>
            This time though they decided to create a game that was a little more "panic horror" than "survival horror". <br>
            <br>
            Thus they introduced a quick, intellegent enemy; the raptors! <br>
            <br>
            These little beauties could; track your blood trail, open doors, and work together to trap you. <br>
            <br>
            And once they had you cornered, they could bite your arms, tail whip you to the ground, or even leap upon you; pinning you to the floor. <br>
        </p>   
    </div>
    <br>
    <div  class = "boxedep rightimage">
        <p>But the game was more than just these terrifying creatures: <br></p>
            <ul>
            <li>It had a fantastic, more realistic inventory system, that allowed you to combine items to make powerful healing <br> items or even poison darts. </li>
            <li>The plot was well written and the voice acting was top notch.</li>
            <li>It even had multiple endings based on the choices you made throughout the game.</li>
            <li>Possibly best aspect however was the amazing puzzles; that had you rerouting power, shifting crates away with <br> cranes, and hacking into computer systems to open escape tunnels.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            When you put all of this together, you had a fast-paced, nerve wracking, horror game that kept you coming back <br> for more. <br>
            Oh and did I mention it had a T-rex? <br>
            <br>
            It had a T-rex!

        <h3><span class = "boxedsmall">Next we are going a little retro, back to the Commodore 64, with Boulderdash.</span></h3>

    <div class = "boxed leftimage">
        <img src="images/boulderdashrockford.jpg" alt = "Boulderdash Rockford" width = "400" height = "200">
        <p>
            Released in 1984 for Atari 8-bit computers (although later released on the Commodore 64); Boulderdash was created by Canadian developers Peter Liepa and Chris Gray. <br>
            <br>
            A straightforward 2D puzzle game; you simply had to navigate you character "Rockford" around the cave and collect diamonds in order to open the exit door. <br>
            Of course it was never quite as easy as that. <br>
            <br>
            Each cave was timed, meaning you had to rush all of your actions, in order to make it out alive. <br>
            There were two enemies: "Fireflies" and "Butterflies" that would chase you relentlessly. <br>
            <br>
            And as if that wasn't enough, not only could rocks land on your head and kill you, but they could also completly surround and trap you in certain circumstance. <br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class = "boxedep rightimage">
        <p>What I'm describing probably sounds quite basic, (and it was), however it had some stand out features: <br></p>
            <ul>
            <li> Despite the limitations of the time its enemies actually had basic A.I. the "Fireflies would chase you up and <br> left, whereas "Butterflies" would chase you down and right, this made them feel more real and terrifying! </li>
            <li> Even though there were only about 12 basic components, the permitations for level design were almost endless, giving <br> it a great variety between puzzle and action.</li>         
            <li> Its best feature for me was released along with Boulderdash 3, this contained the "Construction Kit" which allowed <br> you to design, save and play your own levels.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            That last feature was a total game changer for me, and was probably what got me thinking about game development from a <br> young age. <br>
            <br>
            Overall it was a simple game that contained many fun features to keep you playing again and again. <br>
            If only you could save your progress back then, it would have been perfect!
