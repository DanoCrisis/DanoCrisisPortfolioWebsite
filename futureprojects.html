            Building on what I learned from the shipwrecked game, I want to create a larger text based game in Python. <br>
            <br>
            This would be set in a fanasy setting, with you playing the hero battling the forces of evil. <br>
            <br>
            It would have a much larger map, more characters, and much more ASCII art. <br>
            <br>
            As well as that, it would have character creation at the beginning and a level up system throughout. <br>
            <br>
            I have enough knowledge of Python to start on this but I would need to add to my skillset as I go along in order to finish it. <br>
        </p>

        <h3><span class = "boxedsmall">Project Raptor Pack, a 3rd person survival horror game created in Unreal engine 4.</span></h3>
        <br>

    <div  class = "boxedep rightimageadj">
        <p>
            <br>
            Moving away from text based games and into the 3D world, the plan is to create a 30min playable demo that starts with <br> a cutscene. <br>
            <br>
            You would play as a scavenger in a world overun by dinosaurs, with their team killed by a raptor pack, you must survive <br> and get back to your camp. <br>
            <br>
            Imagine a cross between Dino Crisis and Alien Isolation, where the raptors are fierce, clever, deadly opponents. <br>
            One where every encounter must be carefully planned, if not avoided entirely. <br>
            <br>
            I have been using many, great you-tube guides in order to expand my knowledge of the blueprints system of Unreal Engine 4, <br>
            <br>
            Thankfully I will not be alone in this project, and will have the skills of my brother Matt to complete most of the <br> visual aspects that the game will require. <br>
